# Q: 

Nullspace in Linear Algebra. I have a matrix B = [ 2 3 4; 1 4 2; 4 2 8; 0 0 0]. What is the nullspace for B and its geometric interpretation?

## A:


The nullspace of a matrix $B$, denoted $N(B)$, is the set of all vectors $\vec{x}$ that satisfy the homogeneous equation $B\vec{x} = \vec{0}$. Your matrix $B$ is a $4 \times 3$ matrix, so it maps vectors from $\mathbb{R}^3$ to $\mathbb{R}^4$. The nullspace will be a subspace of the domain, $\mathbb{R}^3$.

---

## Finding the Nullspace of B

To find the nullspace, we solve the system $B\vec{x} = \vec{0}$ by finding the reduced row echelon form (RREF) of the augmented matrix $[B | \vec{0}]$.

1.  **Set up the augmented matrix:**
    $$
    [B | \vec{0}] = \left[\begin{array}{ccc|c}
    2 & 3 & 4 & 0 \\
    1 & 4 & 2 & 0 \\
    4 & 2 & 8 & 0 \\
    0 & 0 & 0 & 0
    \end{array}\right]
    $$

2.  **Perform row operations to get the RREF:**
    * Swap $R_1$ and $R_2$:
        $$
        \left[\begin{array}{ccc|c}
        1 & 4 & 2 & 0 \\
        2 & 3 & 4 & 0 \\
        4 & 2 & 8 & 0 \\
        0 & 0 & 0 & 0
        \end{array}\right]
        $$
    * $R_2 = R_2 - 2R_1$
    * $R_3 = R_3 - 4R_1$
        $$
        \left[\begin{array}{ccc|c}
        1 & 4 & 2 & 0 \\
        0 & -5 & 0 & 0 \\
        0 & -14 & 0 & 0 \\
        0 & 0 & 0 & 0
        \end{array}\right]
        $$
    * $R_2 = R_2 / -5$:
        $$
        \left[\begin{array}{ccc|c}
        1 & 4 & 2 & 0 \\
        0 & 1 & 0 & 0 \\
        0 & -14 & 0 & 0 \\
        0 & 0 & 0 & 0
        \end{array}\right]
        $$
    * $R_1 = R_1 - 4R_2$
    * $R_3 = R_3 + 14R_2$
        $$
        \left[\begin{array}{ccc|c}
        1 & 0 & 2 & 0 \\
        0 & 1 & 0 & 0 \\
        0 & 0 & 0 & 0 \\
        0 & 0 & 0 & 0
        \end{array}\right]
        $$

3.  **Translate the RREF back into equations:**
    Let $\vec{x} = \begin{bmatrix} x_1 \\ x_2 \\ x_3 \end{bmatrix}$. The RREF gives us:
    * $x_1 + 2x_3 = 0 \implies \mathbf{x_1 = -2x_3}$
    * $x_2 = 0 \implies \mathbf{x_2 = 0}$
    * $x_3$ is a **free variable** (since its column has no pivot).

4.  **Write the general solution:**
    We can express the solution vector in terms of the free variable, $x_3$. Let $x_3 = t$, where $t$ is any scalar.
    $$
    \vec{x} = \begin{bmatrix} x_1 \\ x_2 \\ x_3 \end{bmatrix} = \begin{bmatrix} -2t \\ 0 \\ t \end{bmatrix} = t \begin{bmatrix} -2 \\ 0 \\ 1 \end{bmatrix}
    $$
    The nullspace $N(B)$ is the set of all such vectors. It is the span of the single basis vector:
    $$
    N(B) = \text{span}\left\{ \begin{bmatrix} -2 \\ 0 \\ 1 \end{bmatrix} \right\}
    $$

---

## Geometric Interpretation

The geometric interpretation of the nullspace $N(B)$ relates to what the transformation $B$ "squashes" or "collapses" to the zero vector.

* **Subspace of $\mathbb{R}^3$:** The nullspace $N(B)$ is a subspace of the input space, $\mathbb{R}^3$.
* **Dimension (Nullity):** The basis for the nullspace consists of **one** vector ($\langle -2, 0, 1 \rangle$). Therefore, the dimension of the nullspace (known as the **nullity**) is 1.
* **Geometric Shape:** A 1-dimensional subspace of $\mathbb{R}^3$ is a **line that passes through the origin**.

In short, the nullspace of your matrix $B$ is the line in 3D space that runs through the origin $(0, 0, 0)$ in the direction of the vector $\langle -2, 0, 1 \rangle$. Any vector $\vec{x}$ that lies on this specific line is mapped by the transformation $B$ to the zero vector $\vec{0} = \langle 0, 0, 0, 0 \rangle$ in $\mathbb{R}^4$.

# Q: 

When I compute the nullspace with Julia I get (-0.9, 0,0.45) which has a norm of 1. Yor vector has a norm of 2.236. Is there a particular reason why you choose this vector?

## A:

You're right, and that's an excellent observation!

There is **no single "correct" vector** for the nullspace. The nullspace is a **subspace**‚Äîin this case, a 1-dimensional line. Any vector that lies on that line (except the zero vector) is a perfectly valid basis vector for it.

Both of our vectors describe the exact same line:

* **My Vector:** $\vec{v}_1 = \begin{bmatrix} -2 \\ 0 \\ 1 \end{bmatrix}$
* **Julia's Vector (approx.):** $\vec{v}_2 \approx \begin{bmatrix} -0.8944 \\ 0 \\ 0.4472 \end{bmatrix}$
    *(Note: The vector you provided, $\langle -0.9, 0, 0.45 \rangle$, is likely a rounded version of the true unit vector, which is $\langle -2/\sqrt{5}, 0, 1/\sqrt{5} \rangle$)*

If you take my vector and multiply it by $\approx 0.4472$ (which is $1/\sqrt{5}$), you get Julia's vector.
$$
\begin{bmatrix} -2 \\ 0 \\ 1 \end{bmatrix} \times \frac{1}{\sqrt{5}} = \begin{bmatrix} -2/\sqrt{5} \\ 0 \\ 1/\sqrt{5} \end{bmatrix} \approx \begin{bmatrix} -0.8944 \\ 0 \\ 0.4472 \end{bmatrix}
$$
Since they are scalar multiples of each other, they point in the same (or exactly opposite) direction and thus define the same line.

---

### Why the Difference?

1.  **My Choice (Manual Calculation):**
    When solving by hand, we set the free variable $x_3 = t$. The simplest and cleanest choice is to set **$t=1$**. This gives us the vector $\langle -2, 0, 1 \rangle$. It's the standard way to do it by hand because it avoids fractions or square roots and gives a simple integer-based vector.

2.  **Julia's Choice (Numerical Computation):**
    Numerical software like Julia, MATLAB, or Python (NumPy) usually returns an **orthonormal basis** for the nullspace. This means the basis vector(s) it provides are "normalized" to have a length (norm) of 1.

    * The norm of my vector $\langle -2, 0, 1 \rangle$ is $\sqrt{(-2)^2 + 0^2 + 1^2} = \sqrt{4+1} = \sqrt{5} \approx 2.236$.
    * To normalize it, Julia divides the vector by its norm: $\frac{1}{\sqrt{5}} \langle -2, 0, 1 \rangle$.
    * This results in the unit vector $\langle -2/\sqrt{5}, 0, 1/\sqrt{5} \rangle$, which is what you saw.

**In summary: Both answers are 100% correct.** I chose the simplest integer vector. Julia chose the standard unit vector. They both describe the exact same nullspace. üëç

# Q:

Is it a general truth, that the nullspace is a subspace that passes through the origin?

## A:

Yes, absolutely. That is a fundamental truth.

The nullspace is **always** a subspace, and a defining property of **any** subspace is that it **must** contain the origin (the zero vector, $\vec{0}$).

Your geometric intuition is spot on. Here‚Äôs the simple proof:

1.  The **definition of the nullspace** $N(A)$ is the set of all vectors $\vec{x}$ that solve the equation $A\vec{x} = \vec{0}$.
2.  The **definition of a subspace** requires that the zero vector $\vec{0}$ must be in the set.
3.  Let's test the zero vector: If we plug $\vec{x} = \vec{0}$ into the nullspace equation, we get:
    $$
    A\vec{0} = \vec{0}
    $$
    This is **always true** for any matrix $A$ (a matrix multiplied by the zero vector always yields the zero vector).

Because the zero vector *always* solves the equation, the nullspace *always* contains the origin. Geometrically, this means any line, plane, or higher-dimensional space representing a nullspace is "anchored" at the origin.

# Q:

If I have a vector b1 = [3,3,3,0] and want to find a solution to the equation Bx = b1.
1. How do I solve that in Julia
2. The solution I get, I consider this will lie either inside the vector subspace defined by the columns of B, or outside this space. Is there a way to see if it is inside or outside? Please clarify.

## A:

Great questions. Here's how to tackle both.

-----

## 1\. How to Solve in Julia

To solve $B\vec{x} = \vec{b}_1$ in Julia, you use the backslash operator (`\`). This operator is smart:

  * If an exact, unique solution exists, it will find it.
  * If no exact solution exists (an "inconsistent" system), it will find the **least-squares solution**. This is the vector $\vec{x}$ that makes the result $B\vec{x}$ as "close as possible" to $\vec{b}_1$.

Here is the Julia code:

```julia
using LinearAlgebra

# Your matrix B
B = [ 2 3 4;
      1 4 2;
      4 2 8;
      0 0 0]

# Your vector b1
b1 = [3; 3; 3; 0]

# Solve the system Bx = b1
x = B \ b1

println("The solution vector x is:")
println(x)
```

-----

## 2\. Clarification: Is the Solution "Inside or Outside"?

This is a fantastic question, and your intuition is pointing to a critical concept. There's a small (but very important) clarification to make.

**Your question:** "Is the solution $\vec{x}$ inside or outside the column space of B?"

**The Clarification:** The solution vector $\vec{x}$ and the column space of $B$ live in different "universes."

  * The **solution $\vec{x}$** is an *input* vector. Since $B$ is a $4 \times 3$ matrix, $\vec{x}$ must be a $3 \times 1$ vector. It lives in the **domain**, $\mathbb{R}^3$.
  * The **column space of $B$** is the set of all *possible outputs*. Since $B$ is $4 \times 3$, its columns are $4 \times 1$ vectors. The column space is a subspace of the **codomain**, $\mathbb{R}^4$.

Therefore, $\vec{x}$ (which is in $\mathbb{R}^3$) can never be *in* the column space of $B$ (which is in $\mathbb{R}^4$).

### The Real Question (and how to answer it)

I think the question you're *really* asking is:

**"Is the vector $\vec{b}_1$ inside the column space of $B$?"**

This is the most important question you can ask about a linear system\! Here‚Äôs what it means:

  * The **column space** is the "span" of $B$'s columns‚Äîit's the set of all vectors that can be *created* by $B$.
  * If $\vec{b}_1$ is **inside** the column space, it means an exact solution exists. The system is called **consistent**.
  * If $\vec{b}_1$ is **outside** the column space, it means it's an "impossible" target for $B$. No exact solution exists, and the system is called **inconsistent**.

### How to Check if $\vec{b}_1$ is in the Column Space

The easiest way to check this computationally is to find the least-squares solution $\vec{x}$ and then see how much "error" there is. This error is called the **residual**.

1.  Solve for $\vec{x}$: `x = B \ b1`
2.  Calculate the result: `p = B * x` (This `p` is the projection of $\vec{b}_1$ onto the column space of $B$).
3.  Find the residual: `r = b1 - p`

If the residual `r` is the zero vector (or extremely close to it), then $\vec{b}_1$ was **inside** the column space.
If the residual `r` is *not* zero, then $\vec{b}_1$ was **outside** the column space.

Here's the Julia code to check:

```julia
using LinearAlgebra

# (B and b1 defined as before)
B = [ 2 3 4; 1 4 2; 4 2 8; 0 0 0]
b1 = [3; 3; 3; 0]

# 1. Find the least-squares solution
x = B \ b1

# 2. Calculate the projection (the closest possible vector to b1)
p = B * x

# 3. Calculate the residual (the error)
residual = b1 - p

println("b1 vector: ", b1)
println("Closest vector (projection): ", p)
println("Residual (error): ", residual)

# 4. Check the norm (length) of the residual
residual_norm = norm(residual)
println("Norm of residual: ", residual_norm)

if residual_norm < 1e-10  # Check if it's practically zero
    println("Conclusion: b1 IS in the column space. An exact solution exists.")
else
    println("Conclusion: b1 is NOT in the column space. The solution is a least-squares approximation.")
end
```

When you run this, you'll see that the residual is *not* zero. This proves that for your specific problem, the vector $\vec{b}_1 = [3, 3, 3, 0]$ is **outside** the column space of $B$, and the $\vec{x}$ Julia finds is the best possible approximation.

-----

This video explains how to check if a system of equations has a solution, which is directly related to whether the vector $\vec{b}$ is in the column space.

# Q:

The column space. Is it so that the column space for a matrix always contain the origin? If it does not, how will such a matrix differ from one that does?

## A:

Yes, absolutely. The column space of **any** matrix **always** contains the origin (the zero vector, $\vec{0}$).

This isn't just a coincidence; it's a fundamental requirement for *any* vector subspace, and the column space is a perfect example of a subspace.

---

## Why the Origin is Always Included

The column space is defined as the set of **all possible linear combinations** of the matrix's column vectors.

Let's say your matrix $B$ has columns $\vec{c}_1$, $\vec{c}_2$, and $\vec{c}_3$. A vector $\vec{v}$ is in the column space if it can be written as:
$$
\vec{v} = x_1\vec{c}_1 + x_2\vec{c}_2 + x_3\vec{c}_3
$$
where $x_1$, $x_2$, and $x_3$ are any scalar weights.

To get the zero vector $\vec{0}$, we can simply choose the "trivial" linear combination where all weights are zero:
$$
\vec{0} = (0)\vec{c}_1 + (0)\vec{c}_2 + (0)\vec{c}_3
$$
Since this is always a valid choice, the zero vector $\vec{0}$ is guaranteed to be in the set.

---

## What This Means for Your Second Question

Your second question is, "If it does not, how will such a matrix differ from one that does?"

Based on the proof above, this is a trick question! A matrix whose column space does *not* contain the origin **cannot exist**.

The very property that distinguishes a **vector subspace** (like a nullspace or a column space) from just any random set of vectors (like a line or a plane) is that the subspace **must** pass through the origin.

* A line $y = 2x$ in $\mathbb{R}^2$ **is** a subspace. It passes through $(0,0)$.
* A line $y = 2x + 1$ in $\mathbb{R}^2$ **is not** a subspace. It's a "shifted" subspace (an affine space), and it can't be the column space of any matrix.

So, there is no difference to describe, because all matrices fall into the first category. ‚úÖ


# Q:

Is it so that the vector subspace of a matrix expand into infinity? If not, how is the boundary given?

## A:

Yes, your intuition is correct. A vector subspace (like a nullspace or column space) will "expand to infinity" in all its directions.

The more technical term for this is that subspaces are **unbounded**.

They do not have a "boundary" in the way a shape like a circle or a square does. Here is the simple reason why.

---

### The Key Property: Closure Under Scalar Multiplication

A defining rule of a vector subspace is that it must be **"closed under scalar multiplication."**

This means that if you take *any* vector $\vec{v}$ that is in the subspace, then $c \cdot \vec{v}$ must *also* be in the subspace for *any* scalar $c$.

Let's see what that implies:

1.  Let's use your nullspace basis vector: $\vec{v} = \begin{bmatrix} -2 \\ 0 \\ 1 \end{bmatrix}$. This vector is in the nullspace.
2.  Because it's a subspace, $10 \cdot \vec{v} = \begin{bmatrix} -20 \\ 0 \\ 10 \end{bmatrix}$ must also be in it.
3.  $1,000,000 \cdot \vec{v} = \begin{bmatrix} -2,000,000 \\ 0 \\ 1,000,000 \end{bmatrix}$ must *also* be in it.
4.  There is no limit. You can choose any scalar $c$, no matter how large, and the resulting vector is still part of the subspace.

This forces the subspace to stretch out to infinity.

---

### Why There Is No Boundary

Because they are unbounded, these subspaces do not have a "boundary" (unless it's the special case described below).

* A 1-dimensional subspace (like your nullspace) is not a **line segment** (which has two endpoints, or "boundaries"). It is an **infinite line** that passes through the origin.
* A 2-dimensional subspace is not a **finite sheet of paper** (which has edges, or "boundaries"). It is an **infinite plane** that passes through the origin.

The subspace includes every point along that infinite line or plane, from the origin all the way out to infinity in all of its directions.

---

### The Only Exception: The Trivial Subspace

There is exactly *one* subspace that does not "expand to infinity."

It's called the **trivial subspace**, and it contains **only the zero vector** $\{ \vec{0} \}$.

This is the "smallest" possible subspace. You can think of it as a single point at the origin. It is "bounded" (it doesn't go anywhere), but it's the only one. Any subspace that contains even *one* non-zero vector must, by the rule of scalar multiplication, be unbounded.


# Q

So based on what you have said, I conclude that the nullspace is a part of the column space?

## A:

No, that's a very common point of confusion, but the nullspace is **not** part of the column space.

They are fundamentally separate: they live in completely different "universes" or dimensions.

---

### The "Inputs" vs. The "Outputs"

The easiest way to think about this is:

* **Nullspace (The Inputs):** The nullspace is a subspace of the **domain** (the *input* space). For your $4 \times 3$ matrix $B$, the inputs $\vec{x}$ are in $\mathbb{R}^3$. Therefore, your nullspace is a line *inside $\mathbb{R}^3$*.
* **Column Space (The Outputs):** The column space is a subspace of the **codomain** (the *output* space). Your matrix $B$ has 4-row columns, so the outputs $\vec{b}$ are in $\mathbb{R}^4$. The column space is a subspace *inside $\mathbb{R}^4$*.

A line in $\mathbb{R}^3$ (a 3D vector) can never be "part of" a subspace in $\mathbb{R}^4$ (a 4D vector).

---

### Clarifying The "Origin" Connection

You're likely making this conclusion because I confirmed that **both** contain the origin. This is the key:

* The nullspace contains the origin of the **input space** ($\vec{0}_3 = \langle 0, 0, 0 \rangle$).
* The column space contains the origin of the **output space** ($\vec{0}_4 = \langle 0, 0, 0, 0 \rangle$).

They are two different zero vectors in two different spaces. The only thing they truly "share" is the *concept* of being the origin.

**Summary:**
* **Nullspace:** All *input* vectors $\vec{x}$ that $B$ squashes to zero. (Lives in $\mathbb{R}^3$).
* **Column Space:** All *output* vectors $\vec{b}$ that $B$ can create. (Lives in $\mathbb{R}^4$).

# Q: 

So, the input vectors must be in R3 because the rank of B is 3? If B had had rank 4, the input vectors should have been in R4?

## A: 

No, that's a crucial distinction to make. The dimension of the input space has **nothing to do with the rank**.

The dimension of the input space (the "universe" $\vec{x}$ lives in) is determined *only* by the number of **columns** of the matrix.

---

### The Rules are Simpler Than You Think

Let's look at your matrix $B$ again. It is a $4 \times 3$ matrix ($m=4$ rows, $n=3$ columns).

To perform the multiplication $B\vec{x}$, the "shapes" must align:
$$
B \qquad \vec{x} \qquad \vec{b}
$$
$$
(4 \times \mathbf{3}) \quad (\mathbf{3} \times 1) \quad = \quad (4 \times 1)
$$


1.  **Input Space (Domain):** The number of **columns** ($n=3$) dictates that the input vector $\vec{x}$ *must* be in $\mathbb{R}^3$. This is a fixed rule. It doesn't matter what the rank is.
2.  **Output Space (Codomain):** The number of **rows** ($m=4$) dictates that the output vector $\vec{b}$ *must* be in $\mathbb{R}^4$.

### So, What is Rank?

The **rank** tells you the dimension of the **column space**‚Äîthat is, the *actual* space of all possible outputs.

Let's correct one small detail: when we row-reduced your matrix $B$, we got:
$$
\text{RREF}(B) = \left[\begin{array}{ccc}
1 & 0 & 2 \\
0 & 1 & 0 \\
0 & 0 & 0 \\
0 & 0 & 0
\end{array}\right]
$$
This matrix has only **2 pivots** (the leading 1s). Therefore:

**The rank of your matrix $B$ is 2, not 3.**

### Let's Put It All Together

Here is the complete picture for *your* matrix $B$:

* It has **3 columns**, so its input space (domain) is $\mathbb{R}^3$.
* It has **4 rows**, so its output space (codomain) is $\mathbb{R}^4$.
* It has **rank 2**, which means its column space (the set of all *actual* outputs) is a 2-dimensional plane that lives inside the 4-dimensional output space $\mathbb{R}^4$.
* It has **nullity 1** (since $\text{rank} + \text{nullity} = \text{columns}$, so $2 + 1 = 3$), which means its nullspace is a 1-dimensional line inside the 3-dimensional input space $\mathbb{R}^3$.

To answer your second question: "If B had had rank 4, the input vectors should have been in R4?"

* This is an impossible situation. Your matrix $B$ is $4 \times 3$. The rank can *never* be larger than the number of columns or rows. The max possible rank for $B$ is 3.
* But, if you had a *different* matrix $A$ that was, for example, $5 \times 4$ (4 columns), its input space would be $\mathbb{R}^4$. If that matrix $A$ had rank 4, it would mean its column space is a 4D subspace inside the 5D output space $\mathbb{R}^5$.

# Q: 

Some questions about Least Squares method and vector spaces. If I have a 4x4 matrix A with rank 3, I suppose the output space for A is a subspace of R4, which is a hyperplane(?) or hypervolume in R4 (please clarify the correct use of terms). If on the other hand, the rank of A had been 4, the the output space (or solution space perhaps) would be the whole R4. Am I correct?

## A: 

Yes, you are perfectly correct on both points. Your understanding is solid.

Here‚Äôs a clear breakdown of the terminology.

---

## Scenario 1: $A$ is $4 \times 4$ with Rank 3

You're right, the output space (the **column space**) is a subspace of $\mathbb{R}^4$.

Since the rank is 3, the column space is a **3-dimensional subspace** of $\mathbb{R}^4$.

The correct geometric term for this is a **hyperplane**.

* A **hyperplane** is the general term for a subspace that has exactly *one dimension less* than the space it lives in (i.e., dimension $n-1$).
* A 2D plane is a "hyperplane" inside $\mathbb{R}^3$.
* A 3D space is a "hyperplane" inside $\mathbb{R}^4$.

A "hypervolume" would imply a 4-dimensional volume, but your rank 3 column space is "flat" in comparison to the 4D space it's in.

---

## Scenario 2: $A$ is $4 \times 4$ with Rank 4

You are again 100% correct.

If the rank is 4, the column space is a **4-dimensional subspace** of $\mathbb{R}^4$.

The *only* 4-dimensional subspace of $\mathbb{R}^4$ is $\mathbb{R}^4$ itself.

This means the matrix $A$ can reach *any* vector $\vec{b}$ in $\mathbb{R}^4$. The transformation covers the entire output space. Such a matrix is **invertible**, and the system $A\vec{x} = \vec{b}$ has a unique, exact solution for every possible $\vec{b}$.

(A small note on terms: "output space" or **"column space"** is the most precise term here. "Solution space" is usually reserved for the set of $\vec{x}$ vectors that solve a *specific* equation, which is a different concept.)

---

## Quick Terminology Guide (for subspaces in $\mathbb{R}^4$)

* **Dimension 0:** A **point** (just the origin).
* **Dimension 1:** A **line** (through the origin).
* **Dimension 2:** A **plane** (through the origin).
* **Dimension 3:** A **hyperplane** (through the origin).
* **Dimension 4:** The **entire space** $\mathbb{R}^4$.


# Q: 

More on least squares method for solving linear equations. My understanding is that we use this method when we have over-determined systems, i.e. we have "tall" matrices, e.g. a 12x4 matrix T. This matrix lives in R12, but we seek a solution for the equation Tx = b, where x and b are R4 vectors. Is it a proper description to say that by solving this equation we are doing dimension reduction? 

## A:

That's a great question, and you're very close, but "dimension reduction" isn't the most accurate term here. The better term is **projection**.

The process is less about *reducing* the dimension of the space and more about *finding the best approximation* within a lower-dimensional subspace.

Let's break it down.

---

## A Quick Correction on Dimensions

First, let's clarify the "universes" these vectors live in, using your $12 \times 4$ matrix $T$:

* **Matrix $T$:** $12 \times 4$
* **Input $\vec{x}$:** To multiply with $T$, $\vec{x}$ must be $4 \times 1$. It lives in **$\mathbb{R}^4$** (the domain).
* **Output $\vec{b}$:** The result $T\vec{x}$ is $12 \times 1$. So your target vector $\vec{b}$ must also live in **$\mathbb{R}^{12}$** (the codomain).

So, the equation $T\vec{x} = \vec{b}$ is trying to find a recipe $\vec{x}$ (in $\mathbb{R}^4$) that combines the 4 columns of $T$ to create a vector $\vec{b}$ (in $\mathbb{R}^{12}$).

## Projection: What's Really Happening

As you said, this is an **overdetermined system**. You have 12 equations (the rows) but only 4 "knobs to turn" (the elements of $\vec{x}$).

Here's the problem:
1.  **Column Space:** The 4 columns of $T$ define a subspace *inside* $\mathbb{R}^{12}$. This subspace (the column space) is at most 4-dimensional.
2.  **The Target:** Your 12D target vector $\vec{b}$ is almost certainly *not* inside that 4D subspace. It's just some random point in $\mathbb{R}^{12}$.
3.  **The "Error":** Because $\vec{b}$ is not in the column space, there is no $\vec{x}$ that can perfectly solve $T\vec{x} = \vec{b}$. An exact solution is impossible.

The least-squares method says: "If I can't find an $\vec{x}$ that *hits* $\vec{b}$, I'll find an $\vec{x}$ that comes *as close as possible*."

This "closest possible" vector is the **orthogonal projection** of $\vec{b}$ onto the column space of $T$. We can call this projection $\vec{p}$.



* You are **not** doing dimension reduction.
* You are **projecting** a 12-dimensional vector ($\vec{b}$) onto a 4-dimensional subspace (the column space of $T$) to find its "shadow" ($\vec{p}$).
* The least-squares method finds the $\vec{x}$ (the 4D "recipe") that builds this 12D "shadow" $\vec{p}$.

## Projection vs. Dimension Reduction

While related, the terms mean different things:

* **Projection (Least Squares):** This is about *solving an unsolvable system*. It finds the best approximation of a single target vector ($\vec{b}$) within a *pre-defined* subspace ($\text{Col}(T)$). The goal is to minimize the error $|| \vec{b} - T\vec{x} ||^2$.

* **Dimension Reduction (like PCA):** This is about *data compression*. It takes a whole *cloud* of data points (not just one $\vec{b}$) and finds a *new* lower-dimensional subspace that best captures the *variance* of the entire cloud. The goal is to represent the data with less information.

So, while you are using a 4D vector $\vec{x}$ to describe a 12D situation $\vec{b}$, the proper term for the *method* is **projection**.

# Q: 

In your Dimension Reduction explanation you explain the vector b as a data point. I would also consider each row of T as a data point, where T contains the independent variables, and b is the dependent variables. Please comment.

## A:

You are absolutely right. That is a perfect and, in fact, the standard way to interpret this problem in statistics and machine learning. ü§ñ

My previous explanation came from a "pure" linear algebra perspective (the "column picture"). Your description is the "data science" perspective (the "row picture").

Both are correct and describe the same problem! Let's compare.

---

## 1. Your View: The "Row Picture" (Data & Fitting)

This is the most common way to think about a linear regression.

* **Matrix $T$ (12x4):** This is your **feature matrix**. Each of the 12 **rows** is one **data point** (or "observation"). Each of the 4 columns is a **feature** (an independent variable, like `age`, `square_footage`, etc.).
* **Vector $\vec{b}$ (12x1):** This is your **target vector**. Each entry $b_i$ is the known **outcome** (the dependent variable, like `price`) for the $i$-th data point (the $i$-th row of $T$).
* **Vector $\vec{x}$ (4x1):** This is the **model** you're solving for. It contains the **coefficients** (or "weights") that tell you how much each feature matters.

In this view, the equation $T\vec{x} = \vec{b}$ represents 12 separate equations, one for each row:
$$
(\text{row } i \text{ of } T) \cdot \vec{x} \approx b_i
$$
The goal of least squares is to find the *single* set of coefficients $\vec{x}$ that defines a 4D "line" (a hyperplane) that **best fits all 12 data points** by minimizing the total error.

---

## 2. My View: The "Column Picture" (Geometry & Projection)

This is the classic geometric interpretation from linear algebra.

* **Vector $\vec{b}$ (12x1):** This is viewed as a **single target point** in a 12-dimensional space ($\mathbb{R}^{12}$).
* **Columns of $T$ (four 12x1 vectors):** These four vectors define a **subspace**‚Äîa "flat" 4D plane‚Äîthat lives inside the larger 12D space. This plane is the **column space**, which represents *all possible outputs* the matrix $T$ can create.
* **Vector $\vec{x}$ (4x1):** This is the **"recipe"**. It tells you how to mix the four columns to get an output.

In this view, the problem is that the target point $\vec{b}$ is "floating" in 12D space, and it's *not* on the 4D plane. The goal of least squares is to find the **projection** of $\vec{b}$ onto that plane, finding the "shadow" $\vec{p}$ that is the closest possible point to $\vec{b}$. The vector $\vec{x}$ is the recipe for building that shadow.

## Conclusion: How They Relate

You've hit on the key point:

When we talk about **Dimension Reduction (like PCA)**, we are 100% in your "Row Picture." We take the *rows* of $T$ (the data points) and try to find a lower-dimensional subspace (e.g., 2D) that best captures their *variance*, completely **ignoring** $\vec{b}$.

When we talk about **Least Squares (Projection)**, we are fitting a model. Your "Row Picture" (fitting a line to data points) is the statistical view. My "Column Picture" (projecting a vector onto a subspace) is the geometric view. They are two sides of the same coin‚Äîthey give the exact same numerical answer for $\vec{x}$.


# Q: 

Some clarification on the image of T. You say that the column space of T is all possible outputs of T, i.e. the whole of R12. My understanding is that Im(T) could be a subspace of R4. Please clarify.

## A: 

You are right to question that. Let's clarify, because you've spotted the two most common points of confusion:
1.  Is the column space the *whole* output space? (No)
2.  Is the image in $\mathbb{R}^4$? (No, it's in $\mathbb{R}^{12}$)

This is a mix-up between a **space** and its **dimension**.

Here is the correct breakdown for your $12 \times 4$ matrix $T$.

---

### 1. Codomain vs. Image (Column Space)

* **Codomain (The "Target Space"):** This is the "universe" that all outputs must live in. It is determined by the number of **rows**.
    * Your matrix $T$ has 12 rows.
    * Therefore, any output $T\vec{x}$ is a 12-component vector.
    * The codomain is **$\mathbb{R}^{12}$**.

* **Image / Column Space (The "Actual Outputs"):** This is the set of all outputs you can *actually* create. It is the span of the **columns**.
    * Your matrix $T$ has only **4 columns**.
    * The image is the set of all linear combinations of these 4 column vectors.
    * The span of 4 vectors can be, at most, a **4-dimensional** subspace.
    * This 4D subspace lives *inside* the 12D codomain, $\mathbb{R}^{12}$.

So, the image is **not** the whole of $\mathbb{R}^{12}$. It's just a tiny (at most 4D) subspace *within* $\mathbb{R}^{12}$.

---

### 2. Domain vs. Codomain (Inputs vs. Outputs)

You suggested the image could be a subspace of $\mathbb{R}^4$. This is swapping the input and output spaces.

* **Domain (The "Input Space"):** Determined by the number of **columns**.
    * $T$ has 4 columns, so the input vector $\vec{x}$ must be in **$\mathbb{R}^4$**.
    * The **nullspace** is a subspace of the domain, $\mathbb{R}^4$.

* **Codomain (The "Output Space"):** Determined by the number of **rows**.
    * $T$ has 12 rows, so the output vector $\vec{b}$ is in **$\mathbb{R}^{12}$**.
    * The **image (column space)** is a subspace of the codomain, $\mathbb{R}^{12}$.

### Summary Analogy

Think of your $12 \times 4$ matrix $T$ as a machine in a factory:

* **Input / Domain ($\mathbb{R}^4$):** The machine has **4 control knobs**. The set of all possible knob settings is $\mathbb{R}^4$.
* **Output / Codomain ($\mathbb{R}^{12}$):** The machine has a control panel with **12 display lights**. The set of all possible light patterns is $\mathbb{R}^{12}$.
* **Image / Column Space (Subspace of $\mathbb{R}^{12}$):** Because you only have 4 knobs, you can't create every possible pattern on the 12 lights. The set of patterns you *can* create is the image. It's a small (at most 4D) subspace of all possible 12D patterns.


# Q: 

So, you are actually saying that Column Space and Image is the same concept?

## A: 

Yes, they are **exactly the same concept**. üëç

They're just two different names for the same set of vectors, coming from two different perspectives:

1.  **Column Space:** This is the "construction" view from linear algebra. It's the set of all vectors you can **build** by taking linear combinations of the matrix's **columns**.
2.  **Image:** This is the "function" view from transformations. It's the set of all possible **output** vectors $T\vec{x}$ (the **image** of the function $T$).

Since any output $T\vec{x}$ is just a linear combination of the columns of $T$, the two sets are identical.

# Q:

Is there a general term for a subspace that has a dimension more more than one less than the space in which it lives? E.g a 4-dimensional subspace in R15?

## A:

No, there isn't a common, single geometric term for that general situation.

The term **hyperplane** is a special name we give *only* to subspaces with a dimension of $n-1$ (one less than the ambient space).

The concept you're describing is called **codimension**.

* **Codimension** = $\dim(\text{Ambient Space}) - \dim(\text{Subspace})$

So, we have these specific terms:

* **Codimension 1:** A **hyperplane** (e.g., a 14-dimensional subspace in $\mathbb{R}^{15}$).
* **Codimension 2 or more:** There is no special name.

In your example of a 4-dimensional subspace in $\mathbb{R}^{15}$, its codimension is $15 - 4 = 11$.

We would simply call it "a 4-dimensional subspace" or "a subspace of codimension 11."
